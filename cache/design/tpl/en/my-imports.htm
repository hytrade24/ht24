<h1>My imports</h1>


<p>The import interface gives you the option, to import items from your source systems (e.g. ERP systems, import goods economies or online shops).
	For that, the marketplace has its own surface. The process is annotated in details and can be found under <a href="{my-import-help}">Help</a>. In the overview, it looks
	like this:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Create import template</b>
			<br>With import templates, you create an interface between the structure of your source system and the marketplace. You assign categories
      and product properties
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Import test run</b><br>
			Before the actual import, you can start a test run, which indicates potential problems and errors
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Import of datasets</b><br>
			Following this, import the records in the marketplace.
		</li>
	</ol>
