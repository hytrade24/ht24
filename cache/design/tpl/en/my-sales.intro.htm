<h3>Create registration code(s) and refer customers</h3>
<p>
    For customers you refer to to be assigned correctly, you must create a <a href="{uri_action(my-sales-codes)}">registration code</a>. Send the appropriate link to the customers you would like to advertise or print it on an advertising flyer/advertisement. Every visitor who comes to the marketplace via this link and then registers is automatically linked to their account.
